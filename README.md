# Subadub

Subadub is a browser extension for Chrome and Firefox that enhances Netflix subtitles for foreign language study.

- Subtitles are displayed as selectable text, so you can copy+paste them to make flash cards and look up words in a dictionary (e.g. using the Yomichan or Rikaikun extensions for Japanese)
- Full subtitles for a video can be downloaded in SRT format for personal study/review
